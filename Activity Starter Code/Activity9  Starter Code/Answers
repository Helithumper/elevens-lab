1) Size is an instance variable. There is no need since the size variable is already defined in the subclass.

2) Removing and replacing cards is uniform regardless of which game is being played. 
Thus it can be implemented in the Board class and does not need to be an abstract method.

3) isLegal() and anotherPlayIsPossible() would still be called using poly-morphism. 
This design can still work but all of the methods would have to be implemented 
separately for each card game board class.
